## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Search Time Degradation
- **Cause**: Initialization overhead and complex DFS traversal
- **Impact**: 254-1358% slower search times
- **Severity**: HIGH - needs immediate optimization

### 2. Zero Local Hit Rate  
- **Cause**: DFS parameters too restrictive for realistic workloads
- **Impact**: 100% fallback to global search
- **Severity**: HIGH - defeats branch locality purpose

### 3. Excellent Navigation Efficiency
- **Achievement**: 95.7% hop reduction consistently
- **Benefit**: Dramatically improved memory traversal
- **Status**: WORKING AS INTENDED

## Optimization Recommendations

### üî¥ Priority 1: Local Search Optimization
```python
# Current Config (Too Restrictive)
DEPTH_DEFAULT = 3
K_DEFAULT = 8
similarity_threshold = 0.1

# Optimized Config
DEPTH_DEFAULT = 4          # +33% deeper search
K_DEFAULT = 12             # +50% more candidates  
similarity_threshold = 0.05 # -50% more inclusive
```
**Expected Impact**: 30-50% improvement in local hit rate

### üü° Priority 2: Performance Tuning
```python
# Reduce per-search overhead
- Cache similarity calculations
- Optimize embedding operations  
- Lazy-load global index
```
**Expected Impact**: 20-30% faster search times

### üü¢ Priority 3: Advanced Features
```python
# Enhanced global index
- FAISS vector search
- Smarter entry point selection
- Adaptive depth adjustment
```
**Expected Impact**: 10-15% overall improvement
