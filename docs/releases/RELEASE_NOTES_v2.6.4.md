## 🚀 Installation & Upgrade

### New Installation
```bash
pip install greeum>=2.6.4
```

### Upgrade from Previous Versions
```bash
pip install --upgrade greeum
```

**Migration Notice**: Upgrading from v2.5.2+ will automatically trigger schema migration. Your data is completely safe - full backups are created before any changes.

### What Happens During Migration
1. **Safety Backup**: Complete database backup created
2. **Schema Upgrade**: New tables added for Context Preservation
3. **AI Enhancement**: Existing memories enhanced with actant structure (optional)
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive integrity checks
5. **Rollback Ready**: Emergency rollback available if needed

### Migration Results
- **100% Data Safety**: Zero data loss guaranteed
- **AI Parsing**: ~25% memories enhanced with structured format
- **Performance**: No impact on existing functionality
- **Compatibility**: All existing APIs and commands work unchanged

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### E2E Test Suite (7 comprehensive tests)
- ✅ Concurrent operations handling
- ✅ Context processing performance
- ✅ Emergency backup recovery scenarios  
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Full cycle Claude Code simulation
- ✅ Multi-session context continuity
- ✅ System integration health checks

### Quality Metrics
- **100% Test Success Rate**: All integration tests passing
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent operation support
- **Error Recovery**: Robust failure handling
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond backup processing

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Automatic Context Preservation
```python
from greeum.core.precompact_hook import PreCompactHookHandler
from greeum.core.raw_data_backup_layer import RawDataBackupLayer
from greeum.core.database_manager import DatabaseManager

# Automatic setup - no configuration needed
db_manager = DatabaseManager()
backup_layer = RawDataBackupLayer(db_manager)
hook = PreCompactHookHandler(backup_layer)

# Context preservation happens automatically
hook.register_hook()  # Monitors Claude Code environment
```

### Manual Context Recovery
```python
from greeum.core.context_recovery import ContextRecoveryManager

recovery = ContextRecoveryManager(backup_layer)
result = recovery.recover_session_context("your_session_id")

print(f"Recovery quality: {result['quality_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Recovered contexts: {len(result['recovered_context'])}")
```

## 🔮 What's Next

### Roadmap to v3.0.0
- **PostgreSQL Support**: Enhanced scalability and concurrency
- **Real-time Sync**: Cross-session context synchronization  
- **Advanced AI**: Improved context analysis and compression
- **User Feedback**: Production usage insights integration

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Resolved Issues
- Fixed PreCompact signal processing error (`'str' object has no attribute 'get'`)
- Resolved session ID mismatch in E2E testing
- Improved SQLite thread safety for concurrent operations
- Enhanced error handling in context recovery workflows
- Fixed database initialization race conditions

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### SQLite Thread Safety
- Concurrent operations may show warnings in logs
- No functional impact, but consider PostgreSQL for high-concurrency use
- Will be fully resolved in v3.0.0

### AI Parsing Success Rate
- ~25% of memories get AI structure enhancement
- Remaining 75% preserved as-is with full functionality
- No negative impact on non-parsed content
