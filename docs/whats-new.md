# What's New in Greeum v2.2.7

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### Unified MCP Server Architecture
- **Before**: 8 fragmented server files causing confusion and conflicts
- **After**: 1 unified server with intelligent environment detection
- **Benefit**: Zero configuration - just works everywhere

### Environment Auto-Detection
```
🔍 Automatic Environment Detection:
├── WSL detected → FastMCP Adapter (optimal compatibility)
├── PowerShell detected → FastMCP Adapter (stdin/stdout safe)  
├── macOS detected → JSON-RPC Adapter (maximum performance)
└── Linux detected → JSON-RPC Adapter (native speed)
```

### AsyncIO Safety
- **Problem**: Runtime conflicts in mixed Python environments
- **Solution**: Smart event loop detection and management
- **Result**: Never crashes due to event loop conflicts

### 100% Test Coverage
- Comprehensive integration test suite
- 6/6 test categories passing
- Performance validated: <1s response times
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
